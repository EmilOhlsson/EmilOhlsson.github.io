So I recently got notified about `direnv` which is a tool that allow you to set
up directory local environmental variables. This is really handy for project
directories which might need to point out local configurations and external
tools.

It can be installed with
```sh
sudo dnf install direnv
```

And [oh-my-zsh] has a plugin for it, which can be enabled with
```zsh
plugins=(direnv)
```

Once you have it set up you can create a file called `.envrc`, where you set up
your variables:
```sh
echo 'export FOO=BAR' >> .envrc
direnv allow
```

`direnv allow` is used to indicate that you intend to use the values set up in
`.envrc`. This permission actually need to be updated every time `.envrc` is
modified.

More information about `direnv` can be found on the [direnv] website.
